House Price Analysis:-

In this project, I have taken a Data set of House prices to see what are the parameters, 
which could be used predict the price accurately to help a business make informed 
Decisions.

So far,
- I have plotted Living area and Sale price. The plot indicates Living area has significant linear relation with Sale price.
- The overall quality of house is directly proportional with Sale price.
- The Total Basement are of a house has more of a quadratic relation between Sale price. After 2000 Square Feet Sale price increase is qudratic.
- For YearBuilt the Sale Price is linear initially but it increases qudratically after the year 1960.
- The HeatMap Feature is used to find Correlation between various numerical attributes and, to decide whether to use them or to drop them. 
- The pairplot diagram gives us the relation between variables. Variables TotalBsmtSF,  GrLiveArea have a partila linear relation. Also, variables SalePrice and YearBuilt have a rough exponential relation.
